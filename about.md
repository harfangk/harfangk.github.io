**I'm a novice developer**. I learned Ruby on Rails on my own and worked with it for a year and a half. I've also dabbled in Swift and am focusing on learning Elixir nowadays.

**I'm a generalist**. I've been a co-founder, interpreter, and military officer. My foundation lies in psychology, with human and software languages as my favorite media of expression for creating values. 

**I like**: learning, reading stuff, listening to others, discussing, writing, exploring new things.  
**I dislike**: intolerance, irresponsibility, authoritarianism, inefficiency.  
**I suck at**: making jokes.
